## What

Console Bundle is a basic backend system for managing websites. It is a the basic container of a CMS, allowing individual configuration for other bundles to be included. It includes that ability to reuse Styles, Layout, Menu Building and User Management to give clients a way to manage data, or Users.

Using [MopaBootstrapBundle](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle), it allows the CRUD backend to be implemented with a consistant interface.

## What It is Not

The Manhattan Console Bundle is not a CMS, though you could use it to construct a CMS. The idea for Manhattan came about because most CMS's created include a great many features that can overwhelm users. When you Use the Manahattan Console Bundle you build the exact CMS you need to, nothing more and nothing less.
